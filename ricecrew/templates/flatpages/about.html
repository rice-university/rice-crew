        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Rice University Crew boasts being one of the few elite private university rowing programs in the south. Rice Crew is a tight knit family of rowers from different academic disciplines and residential colleges from around campus. Currently this family is comprised of around 30 student rowers that make up the men and women’s crews. The team demands a dedicated practice schedule in anticipation for the yearly regattas while making sure students are balancing their academic workload and other commitments. The current regattas of focus are the Head of the Colorado (PumpkinHead), held annually on the last Saturday of October, and Heart of Texas, held annually in the spring. These are both hosted by Austin Rowing Club, in Austin Texas. Other regattas the team may consider attending on a year to year basis include: Head of the Hooch, Head of the Charles, Slay the Dragon, Winter Warrior, and others.</p>
        <p>“The leadership and teamwork skills that the students gain coming through this program applies directly to their careers and adult lives beyond the hedges,” says Alex Reis, President of the 2012 and 2013 teams. “Rice Crew is unlike any other club sport on campus. It demands time, strength, dedication, and a genuine love for rowing. We can only afford to take the best of the best.”</p>

        <h2>Facilities</h2>
        <p>Currently, Rice Crew houses its boats at Bay Area Rowing Club on Clear Lake. Rice Crew and BARC have been affiliated for over twenty years. This long lasting relationship between Rice Crew and BARC has been encourage and maintained largely in part by club leadership and the current club sponsor, Hannes Hofer. Clear Lake, located southeast of Houston near NASA’s Johnson Space Center, is a part of the Galveston Bay Area. This body of water, and the protective inlet the team rows on, provides very suitable water for the sport. The protective inlet, known as Mud Lake, provides a wide 3 km course with calm beautiful water.</p>
        <p>On campus, the Rice Crew members enjoy access to the Gibbs Recreation and Wellness Center in addition to their privately owned erg room in the back of Tudor Fieldhouse. Both of these locations allow for the development and continuation of the team’s fitness programs.</p>
